Description:
As a World of Warcraft player, we have to use some essential addons.
One of them is Deadly Boss Mods (DBM).
Unfortunately, the creator of the addon modifies it on an approximately weekly basis, and so the player must download the addon, extract it, and move it into the game's folder and clean up the mess.
I keep this simple batch file on my desktop, so every time I have to refresh my DBM, I just double-click on it instead of downloading any other software or doing it manually.
Not a big deal, but it made my life so much easier and soooo much more comfortable.

Requirements: 
1. Installed WoW
2. Installed GIT
3. Modify the .bat file first line. It is the place of your installed game's addons folder (prefilled for an example).
